when i start i look at the proposition it say

it say "My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?"
the i go to website

and it think we can find the password in the inspect the i got in inspect

and i look at the code that scan the password if it match

and i see this "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" !== t.p ? alert("Incorrect Password") : void alert(`Correct Password! Your flag is ${atob(t.p)}.`)"
so i think the p is the same variable then the password is the flag and i see the password is base64 so i go to the cyberchef

then i input the password

the BOOM WE GOT THE FLAG YAY!
